# Pocket Pets!
Source code for my Playdate game "Pocket Pets!", a Tamagotchi inspired virtual pet game. Tend to your garden, card for your pet's hunger/happiness, play mini games like a fishing mini game and a Mega Man Battle Network inspired game, and more! You can find the game on [Itch IO](https://squidgod.itch.io/pocket-pets).
